# AI-for-Marketing
Marketing is crucial for the growth and sustainability of retail business.  Marketers can help build the company’s brand, engage customers, grow revenue, and increase sales. AI can star change maker for Product Marketing &amp; Business Boost.
* EDUCATION :- (Marketers educate and communicate value proposition to customers)
* ENGAGEMENT :- (Marketers engage customers and understand their needs)
* DRIVE SALES :- (Marketers drive sales and traffic to products/services)
* GROWTH :- (Marketers empower business growth by reaching new customers)

* One of the key pain points for marketers is to know their
customers and identify their needs.
* By understanding the customer, marketers can launch a targeted
marketing campaign that is tailored for specific needs.
* If data about the customers is available, data science and AI/ML
can be applied to perform market segmentation.

# K-Means Intution
* K-means is an unsupervised learning algorithm (clustering).
* K-means works by grouping some data points together
(clustering) in an unsupervised fashion.
* The algorithm groups observations with similar attribute values
together by measuring the Euclidian distance between points.

## K Means Algorithm Steps
1. Choose number of clusters “K”
2. Select random K points that are going to be the
centroids for each cluster
3. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid,
doing so will enable us to create “K” number of
clusters
4. Calculate a new centroid for each cluster
5. Reassign each data point to the new closest
centroid
6. Go to step 4 and repeat.

# AUTOENCODERS INTUITION
* Auto encoders are a type of Artificial Neural Networks that are
used to perform a task of data encoding (representation learning).
* Auto encoders use the same input data for the input and output,
Sounds crazy right!?
